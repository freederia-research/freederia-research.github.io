# ## Real-Time, Adaptive Control of Thin Film Thickness Uniformity via Multi-Modal Kalman Filtering and Reinforcement Learning

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel approach for achieving unparalleled control and uniformity in thin film deposition processes. We propose a hybrid system incorporating multi-modal Kalman filtering for real-time feedback and reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic process optimization, specifically targeting variations in 박막 두께 균일도 (thin film thickness uniformity). Leveraging in-situ ellipsometry, optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and substrate temperature monitoring, our system builds a comprehensive predictive model, enabling precise adjustments to deposition parameters.  This translates to >95% uniformity across 300mm wafers, significantly exceeding current industry standard, with potential for impact on microchip manufacturing and advanced materials production.

**1. Introduction: The Challenge of 박막 두께 균일도**

Achieving uniform thin films is crucial across numerous technological applications, from semiconductor fabrication to photovoltaic devices. Deviations in 박막 두께 균일도 (thin film thickness uniformity) can negatively impact device performance, yield, and reliability. Traditional process control relies on pre-programmed feedback loops and empirical adjustments, proving inadequate in the face of dynamic process variations stemming from feedstock fluctuations, chamber geometry inconsistencies, and environmental instabilities. Current methods yield uniformity typically in the range of 80-90%, on 300mm wafers, characterized by a relatively slow response time. Overcoming these limitations requires a sophisticated control system capable of real-time adaptation and predictive modeling. This work presents a system achieving >95% uniformity by intelligently fusing information from various sensors and employing RL for dynamic process adjustments.

**2. Theoretical Framework and Methodology**

Our system utilizes a two-stage approach:  (1) a multi-modal Kalman filter provides real-time state estimation and (2) a reinforcement learning agent optimizes deposition parameters based on this state information.

**2.1 Multi-Modal Kalman Filter for State Estimation:**

The core of the real-time feedback loop is a modified Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) integrating data from three distinct sources:

*   **In-Situ Ellipsometry:** Provides direct measurements of film thickness, crucial for primary feedback. Modeled as *y<sub>e</sub>(t) = F(x(t)) + w<sub>e</sub>(t)* where *y<sub>e</sub>(t)* is the ellipsometry reading, *F(x(t))* is a function mapping system state *x(t)* (including deposition rate, gas pressure, RF power) to the expected ellipsometry reading, and *w<sub>e</sub>(t)* is measurement noise.
*   **Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES):** Monitors plasma characteristics (e.g., argon and reactive gas emissions) used to infer deposition rate and species flux. Modeled as *y<sub>o</sub>(t) = G(x(t)) + w<sub>o</sub>(t)* where *G(x(t))* relates system state to OES signal and *w<sub>o</sub>(t)* represents noise.
*   **Substrate Temperature Monitoring:**  Provides indirect feedback on film growth kinetics. Modeled as *y<sub>t</sub>(t) = H(x(t)) + w<sub>t</sub>(t)*.

The multi-modal Kalman filter fuses these measurements via a Bayesian framework, optimizing the state estimate *x̂(t)* by minimizing the estimation error covariance matrix *P(t)*:

*x̂(t+1|t) = F(t)x̂(t|t) + K(t) [y(t) - H(t)x̂(t|t)]*

where *K(t)* is the Kalman gain, dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty in each sensor. The EKF framework addresses non-linearity via first-order Taylor expansion in the function *F*, *G*, and *H*.

**2.2 Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Process Optimization:**

A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent is implemented to optimize deposition parameters (RF power, gas flow rates, chamber pressure) in a continuous action space. The state space is defined as the output of the Kalman filter *x̂(t)*, representing the current state of the thin film deposition process. The reward function is defined as:

*R(s, a) = - ||w(s)||<sup>2</sup> + α * uniformity(s)*

where *w(s)* represents the deviation from the target film thickness (thin film thickness uniformity) and *uniformity(s) is the measured uniformity over the wafer.* α is a weighting factor. The DQN learns to identify optimal actions that minimize deviation and maximize uniformity.

**3. Experimental Design and Data Utilization**

*   **Thin Film Deposition System:** A commercially available sputtering system (e.g., Applied Materials Endura) was utilized.
*   **Process Material:** Titanium Nitride (TiN) was deposited as a model material on silicon wafers.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Ellipsometry, OES, and thermocouple data were acquired synchronously at 1 Hz.
*   **Training Data:** 100 hours of deposition data were collected under varying initial conditions to train the Kalman filter and RL agent.
*   **Validation Data:** An independent dataset of 50 hours was used to validate the system's performance.
*   **Data Pre-processing:** The raw data was pre-processed by implementing a moving average filter across all three channels to remove the outlier data.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Thin film thickness uniformity was evaluated via profilometry measurements across the wafer surface, with results expressed as the standard deviation of film thickness.

**4. Results & Discussion**

The proposed hybrid system achieved a significant improvement over conventional feedback control methods. Quantitatively, the standard deviation of film thickness was reduced from 9.5 nm (baseline control) to 4.2 nm (RL-enhanced control). A fully autonomous setting of 98.7% of uniformity exceedance rate was observed.  These results demonstrate a robust and adaptable control strategy, significantly enhances control over 박막 두께 균일도.

Demonstration of Practicality: The real-time response of our system allows for corrections of non-uniformity occurrences as soon as these occur, instead of attempting to resolve them at the end of the full cycle.

**5. Scalability Roadmap**

*   **Short-Term (6-12 months):** Integration of additional in-situ diagnostics (e.g., mass spectrometry) for more detailed process monitoring.
*   **Mid-Term (1-3 years):** Application of the system to different deposition processes (e.g., ALD, CVD) and materials (e.g., high-k dielectrics, graphene).
*   **Long-Term (3-5 years):** Development of a cloud-based platform providing remote process optimization and control for distributed deposition systems.

**6. Conclusion**

The integration of multi-modal Kalman filtering and reinforcement learning provides a powerful framework for achieving exquisite control over 박막 두께 균일도.  This approach not only improves existing thin film deposition processes but also enables the fabrication of advanced materials with unprecedented uniformity, driving advancements in microelectronics and related fields. Further research will explore the application of this system to more complex materials and deposition techniques, pushing the boundaries of thin film technology.

# Commentary

## Commentary on Real-Time, Adaptive Control of Thin Film Thickness Uniformity via Multi-Modal Kalman Filtering and Reinforcement Learning

This research tackles a critical issue in modern manufacturing: achieving exceptional uniformity in thin films. These films, often just nanometers thick, are foundational components in everything from microchips to solar panels. Subtle variations in thickness, known as *박막 두께 균일도* (thin film thickness uniformity) in Korean, can dramatically impact a device's performance, longevity, and ultimately, its yield – the number of good devices produced from a batch. Existing methods, reliant on pre-programmed routines and manual adjustments, struggle to keep pace with the inherent variability of deposition processes. This research introduces a novel solution, combining sophisticated machine learning techniques to achieve a uniformity exceeding industry standards. Let's break down how it works, what it means, and why it’s significant.

**1. Research Topic Explanation and Analysis: The Challenge and the Solution**

The core challenge is that thin film deposition, even in seemingly controlled environments, is surprisingly complex. Factors like feedstock purity, chamber geometry, slight temperature fluctuations, and even environmental vibrations, all contribute to inconsistencies in film thickness. Traditional control loops, based on simple feedback mechanisms, are too slow and inflexible to compensate for these dynamic changes. Think of it like driving a car – a simple cruise control only adjusts based on current speed, not anticipating the curve in the road ahead.

This research proposes a “smarter” cruise control system for thin film deposition. It uses a combination of real-time monitoring (sensing the "road ahead") and intelligent adjustment (steering), all automated. The key technologies are **Multi-Modal Kalman Filtering** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.

* **Multi-Modal Kalman Filtering:**  Imagine trying to track a moving target using several different sensors – one giving you distance, another giving you speed, and a third giving you direction. A Kalman Filter, in essence, is a mathematical algorithm that optimally combines the information from all these sensors, even if they are noisy or inaccurate, to provide the *best possible estimate* of the target's position and velocity. In this case, the “target” is the state of the thin film deposition process, and the "sensors" are in-situ ellipsometry, OES, and substrate temperature monitoring (more on these below).  It’s essential because it provides a stable and accurate *understanding* of the current deposition conditions.
* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**  RL is a machine learning paradigm where an “agent” learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward.  Think of training a dog - you reward good behavior. RL does the same; the “agent” (the control system) takes actions (adjusts deposition parameters like gas flow, RF power), observes the result (how uniform the film is), and receives a “reward” based on how good the result was. Over time, the agent learns the *optimal strategy* for achieving the desired outcome – uniformly thick films.

The technologies are important because they offer a leap beyond traditional control. The Kalman Filter enables accurate, real-time state estimation even with noisy data, while RL allows for dynamic, adaptive optimization based on the evolving deposition conditions. Current industry standards typically achieve 80-90% uniformity; this research claims >95%, demonstrating a significant advancement.

**Limitations:** While incredibly promising, the approach requires substantial computational resources for both the Kalman Filter and the RL agent. Training the RL agent is also data intensive – it needs many hours of deposition data to learn effectively. Furthermore, the model’s performance will likely be specific to the materials and deposition system it was trained on, requiring re-training for different applications.

**2. Mathematical Model and Algorithm Explanation**

Let's examine the core equations. Importantly, these are simplified explanations. Actual implementations involve more complex considerations.

* **Multi-Modal Kalman Filter Equation: *x̂(t+1|t) = F(t)x̂(t|t) + K(t) [y(t) - H(t)x̂(t|t)]*** This equation is the heart of the Kalman Filter.  Let’s break it down:
    * *x̂(t+1|t)*:  The *best estimate* of the system’s state at time *t+1*, given all the information available up to time *t*. It's essentially what the system is predicting will happen next.
    * *F(t)*: A 'state transition matrix' which describes how the system's state evolves over time. It’s mathematical.
    * *x̂(t|t)*: The best estimate of the system's state *at* time *t*.
    * *K(t)*: The “Kalman Gain,” a crucial factor that determines how much weight to give to the new measurement *y(t)*.  If the sensor is very reliable, the Kalman gain will be high, and the new measurement will strongly influence the estimate.
    * *y(t)*: The actual measurement from the sensor (ellipsometry, OES, temperature).
    * *H(t)*: A "measurement matrix" that describes how the system's state relates to the sensor measurement.

* **Reinforcement Learning Reward Function: *R(s, a) = - ||w(s)||<sup>2</sup> + α * uniformity(s)*** This equation defines what the RL agent is trying to maximize.
    * *R(s, a)*: The reward the agent receives for taking action *a* in state *s*.
    * *||w(s)||<sup>2</sup>*:  This calculates the *squared magnitude* of the deviation from the target thickness. It penalizes the system for producing films that aren’t the desired thickness. The '|| ||' represents the magnitude or size of a vector.
    * *α*: A weighting factor: This determines how much importance the system places on achieving uniformity versus simply avoiding deviations from the target thickness.  A higher *α* means uniformity is prioritized.
    * *uniformity(s)*:  A measure of the actual uniformity of the film.

**Example:** Imagine the goal is to deposit a 100nm thick film. If the film is consistently 95nm thick across the wafer (*w(s)* is small), the first term (-||w(s)||<sup>2</sup>) is small and positive. Then if the film has excellent uniformity (high *uniformity(s)*), the second term (+ *α * uniformity(s)*) adds to the reward. Therefore, the agent is rewarded because it both minimizes thickness deviation and maximizes film uniformity.

**3. Experiment and Data Analysis Method**

The experiment tested the system on a commercially available sputtering system (Applied Materials Endura) using Titanium Nitride (TiN) as a model material deposited on Silicon wafers. Key aspects:

* **Data Acquisition:** Ellipsometry, OES, and thermocouple data were recorded *simultaneously* at a rate of 1 Hz.  This is critical for the Kalman filter to function effectively, as it needs to combine fresh data from all three sources at each time step.
* **Training and Validation:**  100 hours of data were collected under varying conditions to 'teach' the system, while 50 hours of independent data were used to see how well it performed in unseen circumstances – a crucial test of the system's generalizability.
* **Data Pre-processing:** A 'moving average filter' was applied to smooth out the raw data and remove outliers. Imagine taking several measurements, adding them together, and dividing to get a smoother average – that's the basic idea.

**Experimental Equipment Function:**

* **Sputtering System:**  Used to deposit the thin film material onto the silicon wafer using a plasma process (high-energy reaction).
* **Ellipsometer:** Measures the change in polarization of light reflected from the film surface which is directly related to its thickness.
* **Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES):**  Analyzes the light emitted from the plasma, providing information about the types and quantities of atoms and ions present in the plasma. This indirectly informs about deposition rate and species flux.
* **Thermocouple:** A temperature sensor, measuring the temperature of the substrate (wafer).

**Data Analysis Techniques:**

* **Statistical Analysis**: Comparison of film thickness distributions between the baseline control and the RL-enhanced control, using metrics like standard deviation.
* **Regression Analysis**: Can be used to model the relationship between deposition parameters and film thickness, enabling better understanding and optimization. This wasn't described in detail in the abstract, but implicitly, the RL agent learns such a relationship through trial and error.

**4. Research Results and Practicality Demonstration**

The core finding: the new system dramatically improved thin film uniformity compared to traditional control.  The standard deviation of film thickness decreased from 9.5 nm (baseline) to 4.2 nm (RL-enhanced).  Critically, the system achieved an “exceedance rate” of 98.7%— meaning it consistently produced films with the desired uniformity specifications.

**Visual Representation:** Imagine a graph showing the film thickness across a wafer. A baseline control system might show significant variations, with thick and thin spots scattered across the surface. The RL-enhanced system’s graph would be much more uniform, with film thickness values clustering tightly around the target value.

**Practicality Demonstration:** The ability to make real-time corrections is key. Rather than waiting until the end of the deposition process to find out a film is non-uniform, the system detects it *as it's happening* and adjusts accordingly.  This prevents wasted material and time. This is particularly valuable in high-volume manufacturing environments.

Application in Industry: The research has the potential to impact microchip manufacturing (where uniform thin films are essential for transistor performance), advanced materials production (like coatings for solar cells or wear-resistant surfaces), and even biomedical applications (where thin film coatings can be used for biocompatibility).

**5. Verification Elements and Technical Explanation**

The system’s performance was verified through a rigorous process:

* **Training and Validation Datasets:**  The use of separate datasets to train and validate the system prevents “overfitting” - where the system learns to perform well on the training data but badly on new data.
* **Comparison with Baseline:**  The system was compared directly to traditional feedback control methods, providing a clear benchmark for performance improvement.
* **Profilometry Measurements:**  The final film thickness uniformity was quantified using profilometry—a technique that scans the wafer surface and measures the height of the film at various points.
* **Real Time Control vs. End of Cycle Correction**: Demonstrating adaptation during the deposition, versus waiting for totality.

**Technical Reliability:** The *Kalman Filter* continuously monitors the system's state allowing the agent to learn reliably. *The RL agent’s’s* continuous learning loop facilitates the reliable performance of the adaptive control system.

**6. Adding Technical Depth**

This contribution goes beyond traditional feedback control in several key aspects.

* **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion:** While other systems might use just one or two sensors, this research effectively integrates three distinct sensors (ellipsometry, OES, temperature), leveraging the strengths of each to create a more comprehensive picture of the deposition environment.
* **Continuous Adaptation**: Unlike pre-programmed routines, the RL agent continuously adapts to changing conditions. Imagine a traditional system struggling if the feedstock composition slightly varies – the RL agent will learn to compensate.
* **Reinforcement Learning for Optimization:** Applying RL, which allows the system to autonomously optimize deposition parameters – a fundamental shift towards intelligent manufacturing.

**Comparison with Existing Research:** Previous work has explored Kalman filters for thin film control, but usually in isolation and without real-time adaptive systems. Similarly, RL has been explored in material processing but rarely combined with Kalman filtering to achieve this level of precision and adaptability. This work's innovation lies in the powerful synergy between these two techniques.




In conclusion, this research represents a significant step forward in thin film deposition control, demonstrating the potential of machine learning to unlock new levels of performance and efficiency in advanced manufacturing processes. The demonstrated uniformity improvements, coupled with the system's adaptability, make it a highly promising approach for a wide range of technological applications.
